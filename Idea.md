# Idea.md V1.1.0

## Concept Overview
This project is a web-based application designed to streamline project management by allowing users to view, track, and manage projects based on their roles. The system categorizes users into **CEO, Team Leader (TL), Customer, and Guest**, with varying levels of access and permissions.

## How It Works
### 1. **User Authentication & Role Management**
- Users must log in to access specific features.
- Role-based access control determines available actions for each user.

### 2. **Project Management**
- **CEO**:
    - Create, update, delete, and assign projects to Team Leaders.
    - Oversee all projects and their statuses.
- **Team Leader (TL)**:
    - View assigned projects.
    - Update task progress and manage assigned teams.
- **Customer**:
    - View assigned projects and check progress.
- **Guest**:
    - View the list of projects in read-only mode.

### 3. **Navigation and Features**
- **Home Page**: Introduction to the company and projects.
- **About Us**: Company details and mission.
- **Projects**: List of all projects with filters.
- **Project Details**: Expanded view of a specific project.
- **Login**: Role-based authentication.
- **My Projects**: Personalized dashboard for logged-in users.

### 4. **Backend Integration**
- API for project creation, updates, and user authentication.
- Secure database handling for project storage and user management.

### 5. **User Experience & UI Design**
- Responsive and intuitive UI.
- Bootstrap/jQuery for enhanced frontend experience.

## Goals
- Provide a structured workflow for project management.
- Ensure a smooth and user-friendly interface.
- Implement secure authentication and role-based access control.

## Next Steps
1. Develop and integrate the backend API.
2. Implement authentication and navigation.
3. Create and style frontend components.
4. Conduct testing and optimizations before deployment.
